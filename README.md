## üéØ Quick Start

1. **Course Overview**: Start with the [syllabus](course-materials/syllabus.pdf) to understand course structure
2. **Week-by-Week Study Path**:
   - Read the [introduction notes](notes/handouts/00-introduction.md) or [handouts_00.pdf](course-materials/handouts/handouts_00.pdf)
   - Work through [practical 01](notes/practicals/01-functions-and-definitions.md) or [practicals_01.pdf](course-materials/practicals/practicals_01.pdf)
   - Study [Haskell intro notes](notes/handouts/02-intro-to-haskell.md) or [handouts_02.pdf](course-materials/handouts/handouts_02.pdf)
   - Learn about [induction](notes/handouts/03-induction.md) or [handouts_03.pdf](course-materials/handouts/handouts_03.pdf)
3. **Practice**: Work through practicals in order, checking solutions after attempts
4. **Code Examples**: Explore the [code directory](course-materials/code/) for practical implementations

## üìö Learning Path

### Beginner
1. Read [introduction notes](notes/handouts/00-introduction.md) - understand abstraction and equivalence
2. Complete [practical 01](notes/practicals/01-functions-and-definitions.md) - learn basic Haskell syntax
3. Study [Haskell intro](notes/handouts/02-intro-to-haskell.md) - datatypes and list operations

### Intermediate
1. Master [induction](notes/handouts/03-induction.md) - proofs and recursive definitions
2. Work through advanced practicals and worksheets
3. Implement code exercises using higher-order functions

### Advanced
1. Explore advanced type systems and algebraic structures
2. Work on parsing and language processing projects
3. Create your own functional programming projects

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Setup

This course uses Haskell as the primary functional programming language. Recommended setup:

- **GHC** (Glasgow Haskell Compiler)
- **Cabal** or **Stack** for package management
- **Text Editor**: VS Code with Haskell extensions, or Vim/Emacs

## ü§ù Contributing

When adding new notes or materials:

1. **Structure**: Follow the course organization with handouts, practicals, and worksheets
2. **Naming**: Use descriptive names like `XX-topic.md` for handouts, `XX-exercise-name.md` for practicals
3. **Formatting**: Use consistent markdown with proper syntax highlighting for Haskell code
4. **Cross-references**: Link between related topics and reference original PDFs
5. **Updates**: Update this README with new content links and progress tracking
6. **Content**: Include both theory and practical examples, emphasizing understanding over memorization

## üìñ Study Tips

1. **Read Both Formats**: Use markdown notes for quick reference, PDFs for complete content
2. **Practice Actively**: Type out code examples and verify them in GHCi
3. **Prove Properties**: Work through the induction proofs step-by-step
4. **Connect Concepts**: Notice patterns between natural numbers, lists, and other datatypes
5. **Think Functionally**: Embrace the "everything is a function" mindset
